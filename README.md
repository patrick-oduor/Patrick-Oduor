# Hi, I'm Patrick Oduor | Full-Stack Product Engineer 

I specialize in architecting **high-performance ERP systems** and **automated growth engines**. My work focuses on bridging the gap between complex backend logic (Financial Forensics, RBAC, Automation) and premium, conversion-centric user experiences.
